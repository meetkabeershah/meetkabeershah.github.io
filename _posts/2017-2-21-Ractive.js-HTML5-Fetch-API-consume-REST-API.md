Recently I was given a task to consume an [open](http://openweathermap.org/) rest based API from [Open Weather](http://openweathermap.org/api) using [Ractive.js](http://www.ractivejs.org/) and [HTML5's Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)

The sample [app here](http://jsfiddle.net/xameeramir/boe2vcj6/embedded/result/#Result) takes the city name as input and shows the corresponding weather information below it.

# Get the OpenWeather API keys for FREE!!!

In order to get the JSON data from OpenWeather's REST API, the first thing we need to do is get their [free API key](http://openweathermap.org/appid). The API can be called by simply passing in this app id as query parameter. That's it!

# Setting the UI container

Create an HTML5 element to be used as the front of the app. In our case, it's <code>div#container</code>.

# Implement responsiveness using Bootstrap

Just for implementing the responsiveness, we've included the [Bootstrap reference](https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css). The classes <code> .row .col-md-6 .col-sm-12 </code> takes care of responsiveness itself.

# Set the Ractive template

After adding [ractive's link](http://cdn.ractivejs.org/latest/ractive.min.js), we've made sure that the code in the fiddle will be Ractive-aware.

The template is in the script tag. Note that we've set the <code>script</code>'s type attribute to 'text/ractive' - though it can be just about anything except 'text/javascript'. We can load a template in many ways. For convenience, we'll include it in a script tag so that we don't need to mess around with AJAX or multiline strings.
 
The curly braces e.g. <code>{{location}}</code> are holding the data set inside the ractive function with e.g. <code>ractive.set('location', JSON.stringify(data.name) + ', ' + JSON.stringify(data.sys.country));</code>

# Set the ractive context

The <code>Ractive</code> constructor function will be used to set the Ractive context. The parameters with their description are:

 - <code>el</code> : the element to which the front end will be rendered
 - <code>template</code> : the Ractive template
 - <code>data</code> : the data for the front end

# Catching events

Ractive events looks a little different than pure HTML events, e.g. on-click. They're catched in a samilar sense as that of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).

# Fire the fetch request

Prepare the fetch request using the <code>Request</code> constructor function and fire it using <code> fetch(request) </code>. 

#  Use localStorage to maintain recent search history

The city input is stored in the localStorage instance as an array and displayed as the <code>li</code> of <code>ul</code> on click of each is the weather fetching request recap-ed.

See the [whole code](http://jsfiddle.net/xameeramir/boe2vcj6/) here.
