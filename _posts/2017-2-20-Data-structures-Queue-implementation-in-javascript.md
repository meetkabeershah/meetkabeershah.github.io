The Queue is a FIFO (first-in, first-out) data structure. It means that any data stored first will be the first to be removed - just like a queue.

The person first in a queue is the one who gets out of the queue first!

Here is an example of how the queue can be implemented in javascript. The queue has the following functions:

- `enqueue`: attaches an item to the end of the queue

- `dequeue`: detaches the first item from the queue

- `first`: returns the first item of the queue without removal, just like peeking in the Stack data structure
