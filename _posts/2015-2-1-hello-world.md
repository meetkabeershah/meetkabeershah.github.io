This is [Zameer](https://stackoverflow.com/cv/xameeramir) from [India's financial capital](http://www.incredibleindia.org/travel/destination/mumbai/mumbai-introduction). I have graduated in IT from [Mumbai University](http://mu.ac.in). I believe that by *doing yourself* and by interacting with other people, one can learn a lot.

I'm a continuous learner with a **go do it** attitude. Developing others help me learn & grow more. I listen carefully, [ask questions](http://stackexchange.com/users/2795104/student) and collaborate closely with different kind of people. I prefer [staying up to date with the industry](http://techcrunch.com/), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/xameeramir) a lot of [*technical*](http://blog.codinghorror.com/) and [formal](https://www.themuse.com/) articles, [write](https://medium.com/@xameeramir), [watch](https://www.ted.com/), contribute to the [community](https://news.ycombinator.com/), [stay mission focused](http://nordible.com/), [time bound](http://jsfiddle.net/nordible/mLgkb8d9/embedded/result/#Result), physically fit and mentally calm.
