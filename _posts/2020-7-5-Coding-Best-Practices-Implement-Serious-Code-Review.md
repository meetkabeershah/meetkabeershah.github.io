title: Coding best practices - Implement a serious code review process
---

A. Provide constructive criticism for code improvement to team members

B. Try to get everyone to give PR comments (or at least have a look at other's code changes) irrespective of anything

C. Learn from others code

D. Teach better coding practices with your PR comments

E. If needed, decline PR request in worst case scenarios

F. Challenge PR comments in a constructive way as all improvement suggestions might not apply

Wrt implementing A. after giving criticism, offer help in understanding / fixing the problem. This is very important as lower tolerance towards criticism is general human nature âœŒ  

In short, code review - when done is a very important activity for continous development & learning. 

We do it seriously - if it's not happening in your particular project - start doing it.
